# RPG System

A simple RPG game written in C++ to demonstrate object-oriented programming principles. The game involves characters of different types engaging in combat. 

This project is still in development and is currently being tested on Linux systems only. Iâ€™m just a beginner having fun learning C++!

## Requirements

- **CMake** (version 3.10 or higher)
- **GCC/G++** (for compiling the code)
- **Make** (for building the project)

## Building the Project (Linux Only)

1. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install cmake g++ make
    ```

2. Clone or download the project to your desired location.

3. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd path/to/your/project
    ```

4. Create a build directory:
    ```sh
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```

5. Run CMake to configure the project and generate Makefiles:
    ```sh
    cmake ..
    ```

6. Build the project:
    ```sh
    cmake --build .
    ```

7. Run the executable:
    ```sh
    ./bin/rpg
    ```

## Project Structure

- **`src/`**: Contains source files for the game logic and characters.
- **`includes/`**: Contains header files for character classes and attack mechanics.
- **`CMakeLists.txt`**: CMake build configuration.
- **`bin/`**: Output directory for the compiled executable.
- **`build/`**: Temporary directory for build files generated by CMake.

## Troubleshooting

### 1. **Missing Libraries**

If you encounter any missing library issues, ensure all dependencies are installed, especially `cmake`, `g++`, and `make`.

### 2. **Compilation Errors**

If you see any compilation errors, make sure you have the correct versions of **CMake**, **GCC/G++**, and **Make** installed. Also, verify that your system's environment is set up properly for compiling C++ code.
